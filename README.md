### Semantic Segmentation of tumor from Brain MRI images using PyTorch.
The model architecture used is [UNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597v1) which is trained using PyTorch, and then converted to ONNX format for deployment using Heroku.
Evaluation metric used is `DICE coefficient`, with loss as `(1-DICE) + BCELoss`.



## Dataset 📂
Dataset used for training is from Kaggle [LGG Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) which which contains over 3900 samples obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive.
